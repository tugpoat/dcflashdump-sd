# dcflashdump
Dumps dreamcast flash contents to an attached SD card or to your PC via BBA or Coder's cable.

Seems to work OK, dumps 128K of what looks like flash.
No difference between several dumps, so reliability is probably fine.

Compiling:
You need a KallistiOS environment.
Use the supplied makefiles.
